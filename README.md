# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing Engine for Urban Parking Lots

**Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Project**  
Hosted by the **Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Urban parking spaces are a limited and high-demand resource. Static pricing often leads to overcrowding or underutilization. This project builds a **real-time dynamic pricing engine** using machine learning and economic intuition to maximize efficiency across 14 urban parking lots.

We implemented and visualized two intelligent pricing models using only Python, Pandas, Numpy, Pathway, and Bokeh â€” streamed and plotted in real-time using Google Colab.
